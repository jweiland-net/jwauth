        <source>We prefer to insert the full IPv4 or IPv6 address here. You can use * to mask IPv4 addresses: 192.168.*.*. In case of partly IPv6 addresses you have to insert the full address including mask: 2001:0db8:85a3:8a2e:0370:7334:0000:0000/96. If you don't add the mask we will use 128 which means: the complete IPv6 has to match.</source>
